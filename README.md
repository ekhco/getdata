# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Written and coded by Eric Chow, Dec 2 2016

this repository contains 4 files, README.md (this file), CODEBOOK.md, run_analysis.R, and tidydata.txt.  The codebook describes the variables, structure, and sources of the tidy dataset created by run_analysis.R.  Run_analysis.R contains the R code that transforms the data available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones into a tidy dataset with averaged measurements for n=1...30 subjects and i=1...6 activities.  Tidydata.txt is the resulting output from run_analysis.R.

* README.md - this file, describes files in this repo
* CODEBOOK.md - describes the variables, methods, and sources used to create tidydata.txt
* tidydata.txt - a dataset of subjects and activities and averaged measurements of their motion using wearable devices
* run_analysis.R - the R code used to convert the dataset available at the link above into tidydata.txt
